# vep-noodles
A set of WASM wrappers for a VEP tool. The purpose is to show how portable WASM can be and how good bioinformatic tools

## No noodle!

noodle-vcf uses VCFc4.3 so we had to switch to vcf which not as nice as noodles but is more permissive

## Features

- Provide start of variant list
- subset provided vcf

## Targets

- [ ] wasm cli - part of core
- [ ] python import
- [ ] html
